#' k-gram frequency tables
#'
#' Get k-gram frequency tables from a training corpus.
#'
#' @author Valerio Gherardi
#' @md
#'
#'
#' @param text a character vector. The training corpus from which to extract
#' k-gram frequencies.
#' @param N a length one integer. The maximum order of k-grams
#' for which frequencies are sought.
#' @param dict either a character vector, or a length one integer/numeric.
#' The language model fixed dictionary (see details), sorted by word frequency.
#' If numeric, the dictionary is obtained from the training corpus using
#' the \code{dict} most frequent words.
#' @param .preprocess a function to apply before k-gram
#' tokenization.
#' @param erase a length one character vector. Regular expression matching
#' parts  of text to be erased from input. The default removes anything not
#' alphanumeric, white space, apostrophes or punctuation characters
#' (i.e. ".?!:;").
#' @param lower_case a length one logical vector. If TRUE, puts everything to
#' lower case.
#' @param EOS a length one character vector listing all (single character)
#' end-of-sentence tokens.
#' @return A \code{sbo_kgramfreqs} object, containing the k-gram
#' frequency tables for k = 1, 2, ..., N.
#' @details These functions extract all k-gram frequency tables from a text
#' corpus up to a specified k-gram order N. These are
#' the building blocks to train any N-gram model.
#'
#' The optimized version \code{get_sbo_kgramfreqs_fast(erase = x, lower_case = y)}
#' is equivalent to
#' \code{get_sbo_kgramfreqs(.preprocess = preprocess(erase = x, lower_case = y))},
#' but more efficient (both from the speed and memory point of view).
#'
#' \code{get_sbo_kgramfreqs} and \code{get_sbo_kgramfreqs_fast} employ a fixed
#' (user specified) dictionary; any out-of-vocabulary word gets effectively
#' replaced by an "unknown word" token.
#'
#' The return value is a "\code{sbo_kgramfreqs}" object, i.e. a list of N tibbles, 
#' storing frequency counts for each k-gram observed in the training corpus, for
#' k = 1, 2, ..., N. In these tables, words are represented by
#' integer numbers corresponding to their position in the
#' reference dictionary. The special codes \code{0},
#' \code{length(dictionary)+1} and \code{length(dictionary)+2}
#' correspond to the "Begin-Of-Sentence", "End-Of-Sentence"
#' and "Unknown word" tokens, respectively.
#' 
#' Furthermore, the returned objected has the following attributes: 
#'
#' - \code{N}: The highest order of N-grams.
#' - \code{dict}: The reference dictionary, sorted by word frequency.
#' - \code{.preprocess}: The function used for text preprocessing.
#' - \code{EOS}: A length one character vector listing all (single character)
#' end-of-sentence tokens employed in k-gram tokenization.
#'
#' The \code{.preprocess} argument of \code{get_sbo_kgramfreqs} allows the user to
#' employ a custom corpus preprocessing function.
#'
#' The algorithm for k-gram tokenization considers anything separated by
#' (any number of) white spaces (i.e. " ") as a single word. Sentences are split
#' according to end-of-sentence (single character) tokens, as specified
#' by the \code{EOS} argument. Additionally text belonging to different entries of
#' the preprocessed input vector which are understood to belong to different
#' sentences.
#' 
#' \strong{\emph{Nota Bene}}: It is useful to keep in mind that the function 
#' passed through the  \code{.preprocess} argument also captures its enclosing 
#' environment, which is by default the environment in which the former 
#' was defined.
#' If, for instance, \code{.preprocess} was defined in the global environment, 
#' and the latter binds heavy objects, the resulting \code{sbo_kgramfreqs} will
#' contain bindings to the same objects. If \code{sbo_kgramfreqs} is stored out of
#' memory and recalled in another R session, these objects will also be reloaded
#' in memory.
#' For this reason, for non interactive use, it is advisable to avoid using 
#' preprocessing functions defined in the global environment 
#' (for instance, \code{base::identity} is preferred to \code{function(x) x}).
